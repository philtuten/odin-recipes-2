    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 zucchini</li>
        <li>1 yellow squash</li>
        <li>1/2 red onion</li>
        <li>1.3 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen green beans</li>
        <li>1/3 cup pesto</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp freshly cracked pepper</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp grated Parmesan</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the bell pepper, yellow squash, and zucchini, and slice the red onion. I like to make different shapes for each vegetable, but aim to make the pieces all around the same size.</li>
        <li>Cube the chicken breasts into ½-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Add the cooking oil to a large skillet and heat over medium-high. Once the skillet and oil are very hot, add the chicken and sauté until the chicken pieces are opaque (3-5 minutes – the chicken will continue to cook as you add vegetables).</li>
        <li>Add the green beans to the skillet and sauté for 1-2 minutes more, or just until thawed.</li>
        <li>Add the bell pepper and red onion to the skillet. Sauté for 1-2 minutes more. If water is beginning to pool in the skillet, turn the heat up slightly. It should be hot enough that the water released from the vegetables evaporates quickly.</li>
        <li>Add the yellow squash and zucchini to the skillet and continue to sauté 2-3 minutes more, or just until the squash softens slightly.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat off, add the pesto to the skillet, and stir until everything is coated. Give the vegetables a taste and add salt, pepper, or more pesto if desired. Top with a light sprinkle of Parmesan just before serving.</li>
    </ol>
