    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp steak seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tsp sweet paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1.3 lb. total)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl mix the steak seasoning, sweet paprika, smoked paprika, and black pepper together.</li>
        <li>Place both chicken breasts on a cutting board, cover them with plastic wrap or parchment paper, then use a rolling pin or the flat side of a meat tenderizer to gently pound the thicker side of the chicken breast until the entire breast is an even thickness from one end to the other (about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick).</li>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400°F. Brush the olive oil over both sides of each chicken breast.</li>
        <li>Generously coat both sides of each chicken breast with the seasoning blend. Rub the seasoning into the breasts with your hands making sure the entire chicken breast is evenly coated with spices.</li>
        <li>Place both chicken breasts inside the air fryer basket and cook for 7 minutes. Then flip the chicken breasts and cook for 6 more minutes. After a total of 13 minutes, use a meat thermometer to check the chicken breasts and make sure the internal temperature has reached 165°F, and if not, cook for 1-2 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Promptly remove the chicken breasts from the air fryer basket and rest on a clean cutting board for 5 minutes before slicing. Serve the chicken breasts with your favorite sides and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
